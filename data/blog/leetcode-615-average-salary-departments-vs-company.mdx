## 정답

temp 테이블을 하나 만들고, 여기서 구한 평균을 이용해 `CASE` 문을 사용했다.

```
SELECT Salary.pay_month, department_id,
        CASE
            WHEN amount > average_amount THEN "higher"
            WHEN amount = average_amount THEN "same"
            ELSE "lower"
        END AS comparison
FROM (
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month, AVG(amount) AS amount, department_id
    FROM Salary
    JOIN Employee ON Salary.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
    GROUP BY department_id, pay_month
) AS Salary
JOIN (
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month, AVG(amount) as average_amount
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY pay_month
    ) AS Monthly ON Salary.pay_month = Monthly.pay_month
```
