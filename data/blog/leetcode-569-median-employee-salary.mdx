## 정답

요점은 `ROW_NUMBER` 를 거꾸로 만들어서 비교한다는 아이디어이다.

```
SELECT id, company, salary
FROM (
    SELECT *,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY salary, id) AS idx_up,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY salary DESC, id DESC) AS idx_down
    FROM Employee
) AS temp
WHERE idx_up BETWEEN idx_down - 1 AND idx_down + 1
ORDER BY company, salary
```
